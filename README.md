# Project Title: DineSmart: Restaurant Recommendation & Sentiment Analysis

## Description
DineSmart is a data-driven project aimed at providing restaurant recommendations and sentiment analysis based on user reviews. The project analyzes Yelp review data to generate insights into customer preferences and sentiments towards restaurants. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to extract meaningful information from the reviews.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Gensim
- spaCy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn

## Methodology
The project involves several steps, including data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and building a restaurant recommendation system based on cosine similarity and collaborative filtering techniques. Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and removing stopwords are applied before analyzing the reviews. LDA is used to identify topics within the reviews, while sentiment analysis determines the overall sentiment of each review. The recommendation system suggests similar restaurants based on user preferences and reviews.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into customer sentiments and preferences for different types of restaurants. The recommendation system offers personalized suggestions for restaurants based on user input or selected categories.

## Future Work
Future enhancements could include refining the recommendation algorithm, integrating user feedback for better recommendations, and deploying the system as a web application or mobile app for users to access easily.

## How to Use
Users can replicate the project by following the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook. They can also customize the analysis by using their own dataset or adjusting parameters in the machine learning models.
